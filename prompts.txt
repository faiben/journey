I want to create a landing page for an animated movie as described below: The journey A story about courage and collaboration  The project is a bundle containing a high quality animated feature film and a video game. Synopsis In the late 15th century, Crulo a vicious pirate intercepts pilgrim’s boats from South East Asia, India and Africa on their way to the holy city of Mecca. The parents are transported to East Africa and put to work in a gold mine. The children are left in a guarded camp on the island of Masirah south of Oman. 6 children aged between 9 and 14, from Malaysia, India, Indonesia, Turkey, East Africa, and the Arabian Peninsula, will escape from the camp. They will cross the sea, travel the long Yemeni desert, face dangerous animals in Africa and finally meet the evil man and his crew and free their parents. They will set an example in courage and collaboration.   Because the film doesn't deal with any critical issue, it won't face a distribution problem. Also, because it utilizes universal values such as the unconditioned love of children to their parents, it may be distributed in western countries.  The video game will continue what the film started in an interactive way.  Objective The main objective of the project is the creation of an ethical alternative film and video game production. This can be achieved by realizing three goals; •	- Establish characters throughout the targeted countries to be used for more productions. •	- Stimulate local talents, story developers, writers, animators, advertisers, directors, marketers, producers, storyboard artists etc. •	- Establish local distribution channels.
